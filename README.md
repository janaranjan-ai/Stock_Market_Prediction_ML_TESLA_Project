📊 Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using Machine Learning techniques.
The model is trained on historical stock data to analyze trends and make future price predictions.
The goal is to understand how ML algorithms can be applied to real-world financial data.

🧠 Technologies Used

📈 Dataset

The dataset contains historical stock prices such as:

Open price

Close price

High

Low

Volume

Source: [Yahoo Finance / Kaggle / Custom Dataset]

⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

Data Collection

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection

Model Training

Model Evaluation

Prediction & Visualization

🤖 ML Algorithms Used

Linear Regression

(Optional) Random Forest Regressor

(Optional) LSTM (for future enhancement)

📊 Results

The model predicts future stock prices based on past trends.

Visualizations are used to compare actual vs predicted prices.

Accuracy depends on market volatility and data quality.
